This repository currently contains: 

1. drgraf4_0 - Main source code for drgraf4_0 (written in VSC6 Win9x)
2. DrHlp4_0 - Windows Help File for drgraf
3. drThe Book Examples - Examples from the book

The best way to run these projects is to setup a Windows 98 Virtual Disk Image (VDI), install Visual Studio 6 and run the projects accordingly. One can search the web on how to set these up.

Another way is to convert the projects to a newer version of Visual Studio (i.e. 2018) using their conversion tools, which will take more work and modification of the code since it uses old depreciated Window 9x MFC.
