This repository currently contains: 

1. drgraf4_0 - Main source code for drgraf4_0 (written in Visual Studio 6 for Win 9x)
2. DrHlp4_0 - Windows Help File for drgraf
3. drThe Book Examples - Examples from the book

The best way to run these projects is to setup a Windows 98 Virtual Disk Image (VDI) with Oracle VM VirtualBox, install Visual Studio 6 from an ISO and run the projects accordingly through the VDI. One can search the web on how to set these items up.

__Important files__

* `drProjects/drgraf4_0/Applic/Debug/Drgraf_d32.exe` - Executable drPipe program for drgrap4_0
* `drProjects/drgraf4_0/Applic/Drgraf_d32.dsw` - VC++ 6 Workspace that opens all sub-projects

Another way is to upgrade the projects to a newer version of Visual Studio (i.e. 2018) using conversion tools, which will take more work and modification of the code since these projects uses old depreciated Window 9x MFC.

__NOTE: This is a work in progress, so files/folders might be added or changed along with this README; also this is ~20 year old developement code so be aware of compatibility issues__
