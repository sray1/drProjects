    What is a Node
the most fundamental element of discretization upon which all other  elements are built. 
has zero dimension
may have many DOFs associated with it for analysis purposes
uniquely determined by its three positional coordinates- x,y & z
three kinds as described later

Why do we need Node

All other Elements of a simple to the most complicated Model, 
such as Curves, Patches and Solids, etc. are all generated by using many Nodes. 
Moreover, Structure Kinematic and/or Force Boundary or Initial Conditions may be assigned on Nodes. 
In other words, some Nodes may be assigned a support condition or subjected to loadings.

How many kinds of Node
 
Control Node
Mesh   

Input Node
A Node that is necessary to generate, and an integral part of, a more complex element, 
such as Curve, Patch and Solid, that you want to generate and 
on which Kinematic or Force Boundary Conditions may be assigned

Control Node
A helper Node that is optionally needed to generate, but NOT a part of , a more complex element ,
 such as Curve, Patch and Solid, that you want to generate and on 
which Kinematic or Force Boundary Condition(s) may not be assigned 

Mesh Node
A final Node that is generated to help define a discretized Model.

How do we generate
 
On-the-fly Mode

   
 Node: Input Node Mode 

If the Generator ToolBar is not visible:
Pull Down ViewMenu in MenuBar
Click on item ToolBars
Click On Generator ToolBar:
A Check Mark next to it will  indicate Selection
Generator ToolBar will appear on right of the Screen as shown below :
Click on Node Button of the Generator TooLBar
A Node ToolBar will appear on the Screen as shown below:
Click on Input Node Button or Control Node Button:
Node ToolBar will disappear
A Node Dialog Box will appear on right upper corner of the Screen:
	

On-the-fly Mode
Input Node is a part of a more complex element , such as Curve, Patch and Solid, that may have to be generated later.

Advanced
Clicking this Button will open up the Advanced Option Dialog Box that enables you to generate Node by other useful means.

Cancel
Clicking this Button will cancel Node Generation Mode.

Control Node
A helper Node that is optionally needed to generate, but NOT a part of , a more complex element , such as Curve, Patch and Solid, that you want to generate and on which Kinematic or Force Boundary Condition(s) may not be assigned

Input Node
A Node that is necessary to generate, and an integral part of, a more 
complex element, such as Curve, Patch and Solid, that you want to 
generate and on which Kinematic or Force Boundary Conditions may 
be assigned

Kinematic
Displacement, Velocity & Acceleration type Boundary Conditions

Mesh Node
A final Node that is generated to help define a discretized Model.

NID
Generator will associate the NodeID shown in the Edit Box with the New Node. If you want any special ID, type it in. Make sure, by pulling down the Drop-down list associated with this Edit Box, that your special ID is unique .i.e., does  not appear in the list.

Node
Fundamental Element of discretization for Modeling

Node Data Dialog Box
This Dialog Box helps you insert any special information or access Advanced Options associated with Node generation

Third Coordinate (X,Y or Z)
Please type in any value you desire for the Current Node  or leave it alone. For 2D problem, this you should always leave as 0.0. The Generator always the last value typed in..

Update
Clicking this Button will associate the currently showing info. with the Node being generated.
